        <h1>Mountain Biking, A Begginers Chronicle</h1>

        <h3>Where It Began</h3>
        <p>If you're like me, the reason you want to get into mountain biking is based solely on watching copious amounts of YouTube videos. It all started with a video of the Megavalache, a down hill race that's held annually in the French alps. <br><br> begins with hundreds of men on bikes cascading down a black diamond ski slope. The insanity of the event caught my attention. I kept watching as the scenery changed from glacial mountain faces to rolling hill, then again into dense Forrest. You can hear the clicking of gears as they prepared for obstacles. You can almost feel the gravitation force as they bank the hair pin turns. The split second of silence caused by the tires leaving the ground had me dreaming of experiencing the same weightlessness. This was the start. <br><br>Then came an endless slew of watching mountain biking videos. This time I began to watch the ones that were a little more possible for me to copy one day. I became even more excited seeing what I could be doing in the future and the places this would take me. Im in my mid-twenties, I thought this would be a perfect time to start.  I decided to buy a bike.</p>
        <h3>Shopping for a Mountain  Bike</h3>
        <p>Mountain Bikes are expensive! This didn't take me long to find out. At first I wanted to see what was the cheapest way to get into this hobby. Of coarse One option at the beginning was to stroll down to Walmart and buy a bike for 300 bucks, but every article I read advised against this.<br><br>I started looking into Let-go and Craigslist. These had very limited options in general and when it came to a bike that would be my size (I'm 5'10" 155lbs) the selection shrank. To be fair I live in a more remote area in NY which no doubt played a major factor in the selection.<br><br>I started looking into bike shops and found myself at REI. Going to a bike shop is nice because you're able to fit yourself against a  plethora of different makes and models. REI had me interested because of the return policy. If I didn't like the bike or even mountain biking in general, I could return it. After trying several I decided to go with the Ghost Kato.</p>

        <h3>Here Are The Reasons I Like This Bike</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It has 29" tires which seemed like they could roll over everything. </li>
            <li>It has a 1x drivetrain, which basically means it has one less shifter to worry about. </li>
            <li>Disk Brakes.</li>
            <li>The way it looked of course. Pretty sleek </li>
            <li>It was a hard tale and I decided I wanted to learn on a hard tale before I graduate to a full suspension.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I brought that baby home along side a bag full of buyers remorse. Despite that I was excited to hit the trails.</p>
        <h3>The First Ride</h3>
        <p>I started off by myself. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this. I biked for about 15 minutes before I realized the trails still had far too much ice (it was March) to actually make it up the hills. I wasn't completely sure how to shift, or what gear I needed to even be in. I was lost and I gave up pretty quick. </p>
        <h3>The Next time</h3>
        <img src="pasted-image-10.jpeg" style="float:right;width:252px;height:336px;"><p>I went with a buddy this time. He had a full suspension bike and actually knew what he was doing. I got some tips and tricks on how to keep my bike in the right gear. Even then I spent much of the time walking the inclines.
            <br><br><img src="pasted-image-12.jpeg" style="float:left;width:252px;height:336px;">The descents wrecked my rear. The trail we rode was filled with rocks and roots which turned my bike seat into a hammer drill. I immediately regretted getting a hard tale, the buyers remorse kicked back in. <br><br>Despite all this I stuck with it. I tried new places. I attempted new obstacles, and I proceeded to cause damage to my bike and my fingers. Instead of giving up, I learned my lesson and moved on.<br><br>Within the first month I broke my brake lever by hitting a tree. I did some pretty good damage to my pinky finger too, although I'm pretty sure it was just a sprain. After that I bought a pair of padded gloves and learned a lot about fixing hydraulic brakes. <br><br> Not even two weeks later I dipped my handlebar into a chain link fence and popped my tire. Shredded my grip too. That was an embarrassing walk back to the lot. Learned there that I gotta have a spare inner tube and pump when I ride. <br><br> Each time I rode I learned something new. But I was about to learn more valuable lessons from just talking to people about the sport. </p> 
        <h3>Finding More People to Ride With</h3>
        <p>I started talking to more people about mountain biking and found out that there's quite a bit of people that like to bike. I began making plans and learning from their experience. I learned to stay in the saddle when climbing so I can save energy, I was taught to plan my route so I don't get hung up on rocks and roots on the tricky inclines, I even learned how valuable squats are to my ability to push up steep sections. <br><br>The more I rode with others that were better, the more I pushed myself to get better. I tried Jumps, steep downhill sections, and other challenging features that I most likely would of shied away from if I were alone. </p>
        <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you travel with your bike on the roof of your car, KNOW THE HEIGHT. I made the mistake of driving through a covered bridge with my bike on top of my car. I actually made it through the clearance side on the entrance and all the way through the tunnel. The overhang after the tunnel is what ripped my bike off my car. It actually ended up bending my steering tube. Luckily I have a buddy whos an electritian. He got outa  conduit bender and straightened that thing right up. But please save yourself the hassle and be mindful when youre driving.</li>
            <li>Know the terrain you're area offers. I watched a ton of downhill mountain bike videos on the west coast. Thats what I thought it would be like where I live in NY. Not really the same. Its a lot more technical here and less flowy. A hard tail bike with 29" tires isnt designed to work well in technical terrain. Its like trying to drive a monster truck on a go cart track. It's still fun, just more challenging. A full suspension is more costly, but if you're going to be doing cross country (which is likely since it's free and more accessible) it's worth the extra coin. </li>
            <li>You're not going to be good right off the bat. Being able to ride a bike doesn't qualify you on the trails. It's a different world. Start with the green circles and work your way up. A black diamond trail sounds like a nice challenge but if you're a beginner you'll be walking your bike. That's not fun. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Mountain biking is a great sport. I highly recommend it to anybody who's looking for something to push themselves physically while exploring new areas. </p>
